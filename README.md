   ```bash
   xfce4-panel -r
   ```

2. Right-click on your XFCE panel and select "Panel" → "Add New Items..."

3. Find "Application Launcher" in the list and add it

## Customization

### Changing the Panel Icon

1. Right-click on the launcher button in your panel
2. Select "Properties" from the context menu
3. In the settings dialog:
   - Click on the icon button to open the icon chooser
   - Select from common launcher icons displayed in a grid
   - Or enter a custom icon name in the text field
   - Or click "Browse..." to select an image file from your computer
   - Supported formats: SVG, PNG, JPEG
   - Click "Reset to Default" to restore the original launcher icon
4. Click "Close" to apply your changes

The plugin will remember your icon choice and use it every time the panel starts. You can use:
- Icon names from your current icon theme
- Absolute paths to image files on your system
- Common launcher icons like `application-menu`, `show-apps`, etc.

### Styling

The plugin uses GTK CSS for styling. You can modify the appearance by editing the CSS in the source code (`src/ui.c`).

## Troubleshooting

If the plugin doesn't appear after installation:

1. Make sure XFCE Panel is restarted: `xfce4-panel -r`
2. Check if the plugin files are in the correct location:
   - System installation (Debian/Ubuntu):
     - Plugin library: `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
   - System installation (Fedora/RedHat):
     - Plugin library: `/usr/lib64/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
   - System installation (Arch and other distributions):
     - Plugin library: `/usr/lib/xfce4/panel/plugins/libxfce-launcher.so`
     - Desktop file: `/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/xfce-launcher.desktop`
3. Run XFCE Panel in debug mode to see any errors: `xfce4-panel -q && PANEL_DEBUG=1 xfce4-panel`

### Snap and Flatpak Applications

The launcher automatically detects Snap and Flatpak applications from these locations:
- Snap: `/var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications/`
- Flatpak (system): `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/`
- Flatpak (user): `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/`

If Snap or Flatpak applications don't appear:
1. Ensure the applications are properly installed
2. Check that the `.desktop` files exist in the above directories
3. Some Snap/Flatpak apps may take a moment to appear after installation
